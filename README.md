# Simple Waypoint

This is just a quick muck around with the V2 Google Maps api to create a clickable
map which then draws a route and stores the lat/long of a set of waypoints. You 
can create multiple routes, drag and drop to edit the latest one and switch
on and off the markers for the latest route. 

The idea is to save the waypoint coords into GeoDjango to allow users to create
a set of routes they can save and share.
