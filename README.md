# Simple Waypoint

This is just a quick muck around with the V2 Google Maps api to create a clickable
map which then draws a route and stores the lat/long of a set of waypoints.

The idea is to save the waypoint coords into GeoDjango to allow users to create
a set of routes they can save and share.
